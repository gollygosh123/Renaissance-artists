    “Can I revise the male aesthetic of the Renaissance canon?” This project — and the website you’re exploring — begins with this question. This website responds to Griselda Pollock’s challenge to make a deconstructive move that positions women as a visible presence in cultural discourse, while confronting their historical erasure from Renaissance art history. <p>
    <p> Though the Renaissance is celebrated as a golden age of creativity, its canon remains dominated by male artists such as Raphael, Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci. This male-centric narrative has long obscured the many female artists who were equally brilliant, yet dismissed due to their gender. <p>
    This site offers a feminist revival of the Renaissance canon, focusing on only a few of the great female artists who were forbidden, or worse, forgotten. By engaging with this website, your acknowledgment of these women bolster a reaction against this male dominated canon.
    This website doesn’t aim to rewrite the canon with false equivalence, (as Linda Nochlin warned) but instead to recover what had been lost due to the fixed gender binaries of the Renaissance, as it’s impossible to finish a rewritten canon, but possible to create a revised canon lens.

      <h2 class="artist-dates reveal">1593-1653</h2>

      <article class="essay reveal">
        <p>Born and trained in Rome by her father Orazio Gentileschi (an accomplished 17th-century painter working initially in the style of Caravaggio) Artemisia Gentileschi was the first woman to be accepted into Florence’s prestigious Accademia delle Arti del Disegno. She gained an impressive international clientele, including King Charles I and the Medici family, and worked across Naples, Florence, Venice, and England throughout her career.


During this period of inequality, which expected female submission by restricting women to the domestic sphere, Gentileschi was not able to attend life classes which were crucial for the study of human anatomy, or visit buildings and churches freely to truly study their architecture. Due to this restriction, many women weren't able to pursue artistic training or gain professional work, unless they were born into an artistic family. Luckily for Gentileschi, she was able to study and copy her father Orazio's paintings, which allowed her an artistic foundation she succeeded from.</p>

</blockquote>


        <p>Gentileschi was incredibly innovative because she was able to treat her subjects from a female perspective rather than the male gaze, and as a Caravaggist, depicting powerful suffering female figures from mythology and the Bible as allegory rather than as passive objects. By doing this Gentileschi not only reversed the fixed gender binaries of the 17th century, but also demonstrated how she (as a woman) could tackle these subjects of heroic women with artistic skill. When she was 17, she produced <em>Susanna and the Elders</em>, her first large-scale painting which depicted the biblical story of Susanna bathing in her garden whilst two lustful men peer over at her, trying to seduce her. What is so impressive is Gentileschi's skill of focusing on the feminine experience as a subject to lust, rather than the male perspective. Similarly, her <em>Judith Slaying Holofernes</em> amplifies the role of the heroic female subject by depicting Judith as active and violently stoic, contrasting Caravaggio’s earlier and more hesitant female figure, suggesting her natural passive nature.</p>

        <p>Gentileschi’s feminist perspective which focuses on the female experience has often been linked to her rape by Agostino Tassi, who worked with her father decorating the vaults inside the Palazzo Pallavicini-Rospigliosi in Rome. Donna Tuzia, a female tenant and chaperone, witnessed Tassi’s growing obsession with Gentileschi but failed to intervene. The subsequent trial primarily addressed the family’s honor rather than Artemisia’s trauma, and she was tortured under the ‘sibille’ method, which consisted of metal rings on the fingers tightened via metal cords, to verify her testimony. Tassi was ultimately convicted and exiled from Rome.</p>

        <p>Following the trial, Gentileschi moved to Florence, achieving incredible success, specialising in large scale and full figure compositions which focused on psychological intensity, often depicting strong and heroic female protagonists as equals to their male counterparts. Gentileschi's work gained global recognition by consistently portraying women as focal and powerful figures, allowing her to build a legacy of innovation and influence within the Western canon.</p>

      <h1 class="artist-name reveal">2. Catharina van Hemessen</h1>
      <h2 class="artist-dates reveal">1528-1565</h2>
      <article class="essay reveal">
        <p>Catharina Van Hemessen is credited with being an artist of many 'firsts,' for example she is the first female Flemish artist whose surviving art works have been proven to be produced by her. She is also credited with being the first artist (either male or female) to create the style of self portraiture through the works she produced, which has become so iconic that it is now a compositional approach appearing multiple times throughout the canon, for example in works by Norman Rockwell, Rembrandt, and Frida Kahlo. Van Hemessen was also known for creating a series of small scale paintings, and other religious compositions.</p>

        </div>

        <p>As were many successful female artists, Van Hemessen was born into an artistic family with her father Jan Sanders being a prominent mannerist painter in Antwerp and a leading figure of the Romanist school. This allowed her an insight into the professional art world which omitted so many women without these familial connections. Through her father's guidance she was able to artistically take part within the Renaissance despite its unwelcoming nature to female artists, allowing her a long and successful career as a prolific artist, including gaining the patronage of Maria of Austria. Van Hemessen began painting in her father's studio, producing small portraits and collaborating on works together, with him acting as her teacher. However, her lineage of an artistic family did not ultimately remove the obstacles which stood in the way of women who wished to become painters. For example, neither Van Hemessen or her female contemporaries who aimed to become painters had access to basic painting training - anatomical dissections and the study of the nude male form. Additionally the traditional route to becoming a professional artist consisted of an apprenticeship between the ages of 9 and 15, omitting women from this path due to their expected duties as young girls within the house taking precedence. This accumulation of obstacles, and Van Hemessen's ultimate success over them is one of the reasons her work is held so highly in regard.</p>

        <p>Van Hemessen’s works highlight the challenges faced by female artists in the 16th century. She navigated and overcame these obstacles in her way, establishing herself within the predominantly male canon, by actively painting herself into it by depicting <em>Self Portrait (1548)</em>. This work established her as the founder of the first depiction of self portraiture at the easel (both male and female) and asserted her professional identity and skill as a female artist. On this self portrait  Van Hemessen writes ‘I Caterina Van Hemessen have painted myself 1548 here aged 20’ proving her intention to be remembered as a working woman who was freely following her artistic pursuits. At this time, depicting herself (a woman) actively engaged in painting, was groundbreaking. Additionally, by deliberately signing the painting, Van Hemessen shifted and questionned the art world that excluded female artistic pursuit and a self-representation which wasn’t filtered through the lens of the male gaze.</p>

          <figcaption>Catharina Van hemessen, Self Portrait, (1548)</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Her work (and lack thereof) also shone a light on the realities of womanhood, with her surviving works dating to 1552, and the lack of verifiable works dateable further than 1554 led scholars to believe she ceased painting following her marriage to Christian de Morien that year, proving the duties of motherhood and those of a wife that all women, even groundbreaking and innovative female artists, had to subdue to the hardships and duties of the feminine experience. However, Van Hemessen’s success also allows us an insight into the benefits of being born into well connected family – as with her father being an important figure in the painters guild of Antwerp, she was most likely enabled to claim more freedom as an artist.</p>

        </figure>

 <p>Plautilla Nelli was a nun of the Dominican Order in Piazza San Marco in Florence, and is considered by multiple scholars as the first known woman artist of Renaissance Italy. As a nun at the convent of St Catherine, Nelli was greatly impacted by the doctrines of Savonarola (an ascetic Dominican friar) who called for moral and religious reform and the destruction of a secular society, allowing Christian renewal.</p>


        <p>Entering the nunnery at age 14, Nelli became a self taught miniaturist painter before working her way up and tackling large scale altarpieces. As a self taught artist she looked to the works of High Renaissance painters for inspiration, such as Fra Bartolomeo whose drawing she copied in order to both teach herself and gain the knowledge and skill required to undertake her work. Nelli had no other option but to develop her practise without formal training due to the restrictive nature of society upon women. It is because of these restrictions (such as not being allowed to study male nudes) that Nelli had to copy works from other artists who were male, and was therefore enabled access to this fundamental artistic training.</p>

</blockquote>



        <p>Vasari notices this limitation restricting the study of the nude male form (both due to being a woman, and a nun) and it is exemplified through her tendency to include feminine characteristics for her male characters. For example, Nelli's most famous work of art, known to be the first biblical depiction by a woman, <em>The Last Supper (1568)</em> highlights this. Within this composition, Nelli portrays Saint John at the table as a distinctly feminine figure with soft and round features, and rosy-coloured cheeks. This isn’t simply a continuation of the usual feminity Saint John tended to be depicted with, but instead an acknowledgement of the restrictive 16th century which led to the lack of male anatomy women had access to study from.</p>

        <p>As a woman, Plautilla Nelli was hindered in multiple ways, however none of them prevented her from slowly ascending to become prioress (head of the house of nuns) and succeeding in setting up and leading an all-female workshop within her convent. By creating this workshop, the nuns were able to be trained in artistic practises to produce miniature devotional images and monumental paintings. The nuns collectively produced sacred images for patrons, other monasteries, and personal devotion, with the financial income from these paintings helping to fund the convent. This also validated women within a religion that tended to marginalise them – after the death of Savonarola (whose teachings influenced Nelli,) religious women were increasingly feared, with religious autonomy declining.</p>

        <p>Sofonisba Anguissola is widely regarded by art historians as the first major female artist of the Renaissance. Anguissola not only received international acknowledgment and success, but also left behind a legacy of emerging female artists, and a collection of surviving works that are being held in museums all around the world. Anguissola’s father was a Cremonese nobleman who wanted his daughters to be educated, so she was able to secure an artistic education as an apprentice for a local painter Bernardino Campi, bypassing the social norms and developing her training as a painter. Campi taught her a well-rounded education of the fine arts which few women at the time had access to, and as a child of the wealthy Cremonese family, she was supported in these artistic pursuits. Anguissola was an apprentice for Campi for three years, before working with Bernardino Gatti which allowed her to become acquainted with Michelangelo, whom she exchanged drawings with and received great praise from.</p>

        <p>After training, Anguissola apprenticed with multiple local painters, which established the precedent for all women to be viewed as capable and legitimate students of art. Her success was so influential that other noble families across Europe immediately encouraged similar ambitions in their daughters. Anguissola’s high reputation eventually led her career to the Spanish Court, where she painted royal portraits of King Philip II and his family, holding the prestigious role of painter at court. Throughout her time of over a decade there, Anguissola completed multiple official portraits of members of the royal family and the court, adapting to the expected intricate and formal style. Anguissola earned considerable royal favour, admiration from Michelangelo, and praise from Vasari, who pointed out how her portraits were “so lifelike they lack only speech.”</p>

        <p>As the daughter of the distinguished Bolognese artist Prospero Fontana, Lavinia Fontana was able to take considerable steps within the field of portraiture after she learned the tricks of the trade in his studio. From this foundation, Fontana became well known throughout Italy and beyond, developing and achieving fame. She was also credited as the first professional female artist, earning a successful career within the Renaissance.</p>

        <p>Fontana was well known for her subject matter, which tended to revolve around portraiture, religion, and mythological scenes, with some being on the scale of huge altarpieces, and others being smaller devotional paintings. She began her commercial practice creating small scale devotional paintings, before working up to these larger scale mythical and religious works which occasionally featured nude women. 
Fontana was very popular among the Bolognese elite due to her exceptional attention to detail and impressive ability to capture complex patterns and sparkling jewels—all of which conveyed the patron or sitter’s wealthy identity which was very important at the time. Her skill also lay in including symbolic and meaningful still life objects within her compositions which made her a highly sought-after artist, particularly by Bolognese noblewomen.</p>

        <p>Invited to Rome by Pope Clement VIII, Fontana relocated to pursue greater artistic opportunities, and became a member of the prestigious Accademia di San Luca, alongside being appointed as an official portraitist at the court of Pope Paul V in the Vatican (who greatly admired her work.) With Pope Paul V as one of her sitters, Fontana was enabled to expand her already exceptional artistic talents, which was an opportunity undreamt of by many other artists at the time.</p>

        <p>Fontana was not only extremely skilled but also incredibly unconventional for the Renaissance. By providing her family with a substantial income solely from her painting, she rewrote the traditional framework of the domestic sphere. Rather than assuming the typical female role of childcare, she acted as the primary breadwinner, while her husband (also an artist) assumed the then-controversial role of stay-at-home father for their eleven children. She also retained her maiden name, and her husband acted as her official agent, supporting her career.</p>

        <p>Fontana is recognized by scholars as a woman of many firsts—not only the first female career artist to depend solely on commissions for her income, but also the first female artist in the Western canon to openly depict female nudes. For example, Fontana’s <em>Mars and Venus (1595)</em> unashamedly depicted a nude Venus. She was also the first professional female painter to run her own studio, achieving enormous success throughout her lifetime, and was elected one of the first women to the Accademia di San Luca in Rome. A bronze portrait medallion of her likeness was cast by the sculptor and architect Felice Antonio Casoni too. Fontana triumphed over the restrictive environment of Renaissance society, asserting herself not only as a wife and mother but as a pioneering, professional woman artist.</p>
